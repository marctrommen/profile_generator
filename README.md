# Profile Page Generator

Generator written in Python to build up a static HTML webpage.
The webpage represents a profile page for job application purposes.

The data for the sections *skills* and *project list* of the webpage
is stored as JSON data files. These JSON data files are read from the
generator and transformed with standard Python string formatting
into the static HTML webpage.
